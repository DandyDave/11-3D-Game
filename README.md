# 11-3D-Game
This is a small 3D game I created for my Game Technology Class at Indiana University

I wanted to make a local multiplayer fighting-esque game. So I startedd with the camera 
which zooms in and out with the players distance from eachother. This was probably the 
harddest part of the projeect thouhg luckily there was a tutorial online that helped out 
tremendously.

Other than the camera the project was pretty straightforward. There are two players in the 
game whose objective is to defeat/kill the other by jumping on thier heads. I mixed up 
gamepllay and added a bit more depth by letting players control thier gravity in air (actually
I think its thier y velocity but its easier to ecplain it that way). Player 1 is uses A and D to 
move left and right, Space to jump, and W to float/fly, and S to drop faster. Player 2 can be
controled with both a controller (left stick for movement and float/drop, A/X to jump) or a 
keyboard Arrow keys to move and float/drop and Num 0 to jump. Also the players gravity/y velocity 
gets reset when they touch the ground/surface.
